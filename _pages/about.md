I am a **Senior Lecturer (~Associate Professor)** in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence at the [Department of Computer Science](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/), [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/), where I lead the **Fusion Intelligence Laboratory** and serve as the Deputy Director of Business Engagement & Innovation. I am also a core member of the **Exeter Computer Vision Group**. In addition, I am a Visiting Researcher at the [Personal Robotics Laboratory](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/personal-robotics/), [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). 

Previously, I was a **Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellow** (Horizon 2020) at the Personal Robotics Laboratory, Imperial College London, working with [Prof. Yiannis Demiris](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/y.demiris). Before that, I was a Teaching Fellow (where I taught the Deep Learning module together with [Prof. Krystian Mikolajczyk](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/k.mikolajczyk)) and a Research Associate (where I worked with Prof. Yiannis Demiris)  in the same department at Imperial College London. 

I have been a Fellow of the [Higher Education Academy (HEA)](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/) since July 2023. I have been listed among the **World’s Top 2% Scientists** ([Stanford University's list](https://topresearcherslist.com/), 2023 and 2024)! 

In March 2024, I was featured as "[Imperial People](https://blogs.imperial.ac.uk/imperial-people/2024/03/11/xingchen-zhang-marie-sklodowska-curie-individual-fellow-department-of-electrical-and-electronic-engineering/)" by Imperial College London. In December 2023, I received the [Imperial's EEE Department Award for Citizenship and Community](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/250163/great-contributions-eee-thanks-celebrates-colleagues/). In November 2023, I was selected as the "[Fellow of the Month](https://icpostdocfellowsdevelopmentcentreepm.newsweaver.com/6fmnosak95/1d91qfpwhn6m5ti3wepqzp?email=true&lang=en&a=6&p=11850824&t=3895058)" by the Postdocs and Fellows Development Centre (PFDC) of Imperial College London. In 2021, I was awarded the prestigious Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship by the European Commission. Additionally, I have co-authored a book entitled [**Image Fusion**](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-15-4867-3#aboutAuthors), which won the **National Science and Technology Academic Publications Fund of China (2019)**. I also received the Best Paper Honorable Mention Award of the 9th Chinese Conference on Information Fusion (2019). 

I am a member of the UKRI Talent Peer Review College, where I review prestigious funding schemes, including the UKRI Future Leaders Fellowships, EPSRC Open Fellowship, EPSRC New Investigator Award, and EPSRC Standard Research Grant. Additionally, I serve as a reviewer for more than 20 well-known journals (e.g., IEEE TPAMI, IJCV, IEEE TIP, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TMM, IEEE TIM, IEEE RAL, Information Fusion) and more than 10 top-tier conferences (e.g., CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, AAAI, ICRA, IROS).
