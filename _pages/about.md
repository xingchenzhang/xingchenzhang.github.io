I am a Senior Lecturer in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence at the Department of Computer Science, University of Exeter. Before this, I was a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellow at the [Personal Robotics Laboratory](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/personal-robotics/), [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), working with [Prof. Yiannis Demiris](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/y.demiris). Prior to this, I was a Teaching Fellow and Research Associate in the same department at Imperial College London. Additionally, I have worked as the main supervisor of MSc students, [Assistant Supervisor](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/cornerstone/supervisors-guidebook/cpd/assistant-supervisors/) and Mentor for [Imperial’s Activate Student Mentoring Programme](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/wellbeing-and-support/activate-student-mentoring-programme/), at Imperial College London.

I am also a Visting Researcher at the Personal Robotics Laboratory, Imperial College London. I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (HEA).

In 2024, I was featured as "[Imperial People](https://blogs.imperial.ac.uk/imperial-people/2024/03/11/xingchen-zhang-marie-sklodowska-curie-individual-fellow-department-of-electrical-and-electronic-engineering/)" by Imperial College London. In 2023, I received the [Imperial's EEE Department Award for Citizenship and Community](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/250163/great-contributions-eee-thanks-celebrates-colleagues/). I was selected as the "[Fellow of the Month](https://icpostdocfellowsdevelopmentcentreepm.newsweaver.com/6fmnosak95/1d91qfpwhn6m5ti3wepqzp?email=true&lang=en&a=6&p=11850824&t=3895058)" by the Postdocs and Fellows Development Centre (PFDC) of Imperial College London in November 2023.  I co-authored a book entitled [Image Fusion](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-15-4867-3#aboutAuthors), which won the National Science and Technology Academic Publications Fund of China (2019). I received the Best Paper Honorable Mention Award of the 9th Chinese Conference on Information Fusion (2019). 

I am a member of the UKRI Talent Peer Review College, where I review the prestigious UKRI Future Leaders Fellowships, EPSRC New Investigator Award, EPSRC Open Fellowship, and EPSRC Standard Research Grant. I am also a reviewer for more than 20 well-known journals (e.g., IEEE TPAMI, IJCV, IEEE TIP, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TMM, IEEE TIM, IEEE RAL, Information Fusion) and more than 10 conferences (e.g., CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, AAAI, BMVC, ACCV, ICRA, IROS).
