I am a **Senior Lecturer (~Associate Professor)** in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence at the [Department of Computer Science](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/), [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/), where I lead the **Fusion Intelligence Laboratory**. I am a core member of the **Exeter Computer Vision Group** and the Deputy Director of Business Engagement & Innovation at the Department of Computing Science. I am also a Visiting Researcher at the [Personal Robotics Laboratory](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/personal-robotics/), [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). 

Previously, I was a **Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellow** (Horizon 2020) at the Personal Robotics Laboratory, Imperial College London, working with [Prof. Yiannis Demiris](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/y.demiris). Before that, I was a Teaching Fellow (working with [Prof. Krystian Mikolajczyk](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/k.mikolajczyk)) and Research Associate (working with Prof. Yiannis Demiris)  in the same department at Imperial College London. Additionally, I have previously held several roles at Imperial College London, including main supervisor of MSc students, [Assistant Supervisor](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/cornerstone/supervisors-guidebook/cpd/assistant-supervisors/) and Mentor for [Imperial’s Activate Student Mentoring Programme](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/wellbeing-and-support/activate-student-mentoring-programme/).

I am a Fellow of the [Higher Education Academy (HEA)](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/) since July 2023. I have been listed among the **World’s Top 2% Scientists** ([Stanford University's list](https://topresearcherslist.com/), 2023, 2024)! 

In March 2024, I was featured as "[Imperial People](https://blogs.imperial.ac.uk/imperial-people/2024/03/11/xingchen-zhang-marie-sklodowska-curie-individual-fellow-department-of-electrical-and-electronic-engineering/)" by Imperial College London. In December 2023, I received the [Imperial's EEE Department Award for Citizenship and Community](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/250163/great-contributions-eee-thanks-celebrates-colleagues/). In November 2023, I was selected as the "[Fellow of the Month](https://icpostdocfellowsdevelopmentcentreepm.newsweaver.com/6fmnosak95/1d91qfpwhn6m5ti3wepqzp?email=true&lang=en&a=6&p=11850824&t=3895058)" by the Postdocs and Fellows Development Centre (PFDC) of Imperial College London. In 2021, I was awarded the prestigious Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellowship by the European Commission. Additionally, I co-authored a book entitled [**Image Fusion**](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-15-4867-3#aboutAuthors), which won the **National Science and Technology Academic Publications Fund of China (2019)**. I received the Best Paper Honorable Mention Award of the 9th Chinese Conference on Information Fusion (2019). 

I am a member of the UKRI Talent Peer Review College, where I review the prestigious UKRI Future Leaders Fellowships, EPSRC Open Fellowship, EPSRC New Investigator Award, and EPSRC Standard Research Grant. I am also a reviewer for more than 20 well-known journals (e.g., IEEE TPAMI, IJCV, IEEE TIP, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TMM, IEEE TIM, IEEE RAL, Information Fusion) and more than 10 conferences (e.g., CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, AAAI, BMVC, ACCV, ICRA, IROS).
