I am a **Senior Lecturer (~Associate Professor)** in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence at the [Department of Computer Science](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/), [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/), where I lead the **Fusion Intelligence Laboratory** and serve as the Deputy Director of Business Engagement & Innovation. 

Previously, I was a Visiting Researcher and a **Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellow** (Horizon 2020) at the [Personal Robotics Laboratory](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/personal-robotics/), [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), working with [Prof. Yiannis Demiris](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/y.demiris) (Royal Academy of Engineering Chair in Emerging Technologies). Before that, I was a Teaching Fellow (where I taught the Deep Learning module together with [Prof. Krystian Mikolajczyk](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/k.mikolajczyk)) and a Research Associate (where I worked with Prof. Yiannis Demiris and collaborated with [Prof. Panagiotis Angeloudis](https://transport-systems.imperial.ac.uk/))  in the same department at Imperial College London. 

I have been a **Fellow of the [Higher Education Academy (HEA)](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/)** since July 2023. I have been listed among the **World’s Top 2% Scientists** ([Stanford University's list](https://topresearcherslist.com/), 2023 and 2024)! 

In June 2025, I received the **Dean of PGR’s Commendation for Excellence in Supervision** at the University of Exeter. In March 2024, I was featured as "[Imperial People](https://blogs.imperial.ac.uk/imperial-people/2024/03/11/xingchen-zhang-marie-sklodowska-curie-individual-fellow-department-of-electrical-and-electronic-engineering/)" by Imperial College London. In December 2023, I received the [Imperial's EEE Department Award for Citizenship and Community](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/250163/great-contributions-eee-thanks-celebrates-colleagues/). In November 2023, I was selected as the "[Fellow of the Month](https://icpostdocfellowsdevelopmentcentreepm.newsweaver.com/6fmnosak95/1d91qfpwhn6m5ti3wepqzp?email=true&lang=en&a=6&p=11850824&t=3895058)" by the Postdocs and Fellows Development Centre (PFDC) of Imperial College London.

Research interests
--
My Fusion Intelligence Laboratory aims to use machine intelligence and multi-source information fusion to benefit humanity. I am very interested in applying fusion intelligence in medical data processing, robot perception, and computer vision. Specifically, my research areas include

- Computer vision (e.g., object tracking, human pose estimation, human behavior prediction)   
- Deep learning (e.g., multi-modal learning, self-supervised learning, graph-based learning)  
- Image fusion (visible-infrared, multi-focus, multi-exposure, multi-modal medical image)  
- Multimodal applications (e.g., RGB-T tracking, RGB-T segmentation, RGB-T crowd counting)  
- Robotics and AI (e.g., Robot perception)
- Ethical AI (pedestrian privacy protection)
- AI for Science
