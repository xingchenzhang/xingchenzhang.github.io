I am a Senior Lecturer (~Associate Professor) in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence at the [Department of Computer Science](https://computerscience.exeter.ac.uk/), [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/), where I lead the Fusion Intelligence Lab. Starting from 1st September 2024, I will also serve as the Deputy Director of Business Engagement & Innovation at the Department. I am also a Visiting Researcher at the [Personal Robotics Laboratory](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/personal-robotics/), [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). Previously, I was a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual Fellow at the Personal Robotics Laboratory, Imperial College London, working with [Prof. Yiannis Demiris](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/y.demiris). Before that, I was a Teaching Fellow and Research Associate in the same department at Imperial College London. Additionally, I have previously held several roles at Imperial College London, including main supervisor of one MSc student, [Assistant Supervisor](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/cornerstone/supervisors-guidebook/cpd/assistant-supervisors/) and Mentor for [Imperial’s Activate Student Mentoring Programme](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/wellbeing-and-support/activate-student-mentoring-programme/).

I am a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (HEA).
