My research areas include
   
- Computer vision (e.g., object tracking, human pose estimation, human behavior prediction)   
- Deep learning (e.g., multi-modal learning, self-supervised learning, graph-based learning)  
- Image fusion (visible-infrared, multi-focus, multi-exposure)  
- Multimodal perception and applications (e.g., RGB-T tracking, robot perception)  
- Ethical AI (pedestrian privacy protection)   

1. Pedestrian privacy protection
--

In this project, we aim to protect pedestrian privacy in videos captured by cameras mounted on robots and vehicles.
