I have supervised and co-supervised students at various universities and continue to do so in my current role. I deeply enjoy supporting students' growth and development through my supervision. As Mencius the philosopher said, **attracting talented individuals from all over the world and educating them is one of the greatest joys in life.**

## **Current team**

### University of Exeter:

At the University of Exeter, I lead the **Fusion Intelligence Laboratory**, where I supervise PhD, MSc, and undergraduate students.
