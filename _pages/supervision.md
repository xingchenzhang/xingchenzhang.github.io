I have supervised and co-supervised students at different universities. I enjoy doing research and seeing students improve through my supervision. 

**At the University of Exeter**

If you want to join my research group, please send me an email. For more details, see the 'Join My Group' section.

**At Imperial College London**

I was a primary supervisor of MSc students in Applied Machine Learning at EEE from 2022 to 2023 and has been an [Assistant Supervisor](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/cornerstone/supervisors-guidebook/cpd/assistant-supervisors/) appointed by Imperial College since December 2020. **All the MSc students I supervised or co-supervised at Imperial College got their degrees with distinction**. I am a mentor of [Imperial’s Activate Student Mentoring Programm](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/students/academic-support/graduate-school/wellbeing-and-support/activate-student-mentoring-programme/), where I support one PhD student to enhance her academic and professional development.
