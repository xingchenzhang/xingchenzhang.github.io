[11/2023] I gave an invited talk at the Redwood Academy entitled "Beauty of fusion: Deep learning-based image fusion and its applications" on 8th November 2023.

[11/2023] My MSc student obtained his degree with distinction! Congratulations to Zixian! So far, **all the MSc students I supervised or co-supervised at Imperial College London have got distinction**!

[09/2023] I have been listed among the **<span style="color: red;">World's Top 2% Scientists</span>** ([Stanford University's list](https://topresearcherslist.com/), 2023)!

[07/2023] It was a very nice experience to show EEE kids what we are doing at the Personal Robotics Lab at the Faculty of Engineering's "Bring Your Child to Work Day"! In particular, I showcased the Unusual Cameras (thermal camera, event camera) of our lab. [[Imperial News]](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/246594/cool-exciting-place-work-families-agree/).

[07/2023] I am now a **<span style="color: red;">Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (HEA)</span>**!
